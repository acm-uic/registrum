What is the plan of attack for finishing Checkpoint 5?

- What functionality remains to be finished
  - Client PWA Working with   - JIgar / Arshad / Clark
  - Add more notifications option - Alex
  - Selective sync of watched classes - Bharat
- What changes, if any, do you want to make from your original plan?
  - Text to email temporarily
- What is your reason for making those changes (i.e. what you did try, what you learned, what you realized is way harder than it needed to be, and how you realized that)?
  - PWA doesn’t work on iOS
  - Need an alternatives for PWA notifications & email is a good approach
