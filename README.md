# Dream Team Final Project

TODO: Fill out this file with the following information

## Description

TODO: An English language description of what your application does, intended for a developer
audience. Pretend this is the real `README.md` for your app that will show up on GitHub: what do you
want people to know about it? What does it do? Why should they use it/check it out/hack on it? This
should be approximately two paragraphs. Take a look at the description of your favorite software
repository for inspiration.

## Authors

TODO: List group members, each group member must EITHER be marked "web programming novice" OR list a
specialization - you don't need to implement it all yourself, but you do need to be in charge of
getting it described and added. Your expertise self-evaluation is completely on the honor system.

For instance:

| Member           | Web dev level                   | Specialization |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Arshad Narmawala | Done a couple projects in React | Mobile         |
| Alex Chomiak     |                                 |                |
| Jigar Patel      |                                 |                |
| Clark Chen       |                                 |                |
| Bharat Middha    |                                 |                |

## Deliverables for checkpoint 2

Outline in English what the deliverables will be for checkpoint 2. Provide a concise list that is
amenable to being translated into specific tests. Pro-tip: if you write that concise list here, you
should be able to easily translate it into a collection of test suites.

For each specialization, you must list specific checkpoints that are relevant to that particular specialization.

## Deliverables for checkpoint 4

Outline in English what the deliverables will be for checkpoint 4. Reminder that this is not _due_
until checkpoint 2, but failing to plan is planning to fail.

For each specialization, you must list specific checkpoints that are relevant to that particular specialization.

## Deliverables for final project

Outline in English what the deliverables will be for the final checkpoint. This will should be
similar to the **Description** above, but written out as an explicit checklist rather than a human
readable description. Reminder that this is not _due_ until checkpoint 4, but failing to plan is
planning to fail.

For each specialization, you must list specific checkpoints that are relevant to that particular specialization.

## Specialization deliverables

For each student/team adding a specialization, name that specialization and describe what
functionality you will be adding.

# Installation

By the time you get to the end of the final project, this section should have a full set of
instructions for how to spin up your app.
