## Description

The application will allow users to subscribe and receive notifications from classes at UIC based on when the class opens/closes. It is very similar in function to the Coursicle/Seatcheck applications that students have used in the past to keep an eye on classes they want to get into.

- Push notifications from PWA (Android for now)
- Application will be written in typescript

## Questions for checkpoint 1

Test Cases are written in tests file within api
Test Cases are as follows for now:

- Authentication Tests
  - Logs user incorrectly using email, password
  - Logs user out correctly
  - Cannot log in with incorrect email
  - Cannot login with an incorrect password
  - Error with status code 401 when attempting to log out when not logged in
  - Can't log in when already logged in, error thrown
- Class Tests
  - Correctly add class to user watch list
  - Correctly remove class from user watch list
  - Correctly retrieves list of class subjects from Banner DB
  - Correctly retrieves classes for given subject

Security Evaluation

- What things would an attacker potentially want to do using our app that we wouldnâ€™t want them to do?
  - Making too many API requests
  - Possibly implement API rate limiting
  - API Response Caching
  - XSS Attacks through username & password fields
  - Session hijacking
  - Unauthorized page access
  - CSRF - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  - Attacks to query class microservice (Manipulating API to instruct microservices to spam requests to Banner)
- What best practices will we follow security wise for this assignment?
  - How will we accomplish them?
  - Implement security rules on db side to prevent unauthorized http calls
  - Add user authentication
  - Use a front end framework that escapes characters for XSS

## Deliverables for checkpoint 2

We will have basic CRUD functionality ready by allowing for user login/registration. And some form of user profile manipulation

## Deliverables for checkpoint 4

Basic microservice functionality, client completion, completed API.

## Deliverables for final project

The full application will be completed with an API, Microservice and React/Typescript client
